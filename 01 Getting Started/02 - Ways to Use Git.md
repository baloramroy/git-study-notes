# Ways to Use Git

Git is a **distributed version control system**, and one of its strengths is that it can be used in **multiple ways**, depending on your workflow, environment, and comfort level.

There are **three primary ways to use Git**:

1. **Command Line (CLI)** – Most powerful and universal
2. **Code Editors & IDEs** – Balanced and developer-friendly
3. **Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)** – Visual and beginner-oriented

## 1. Using Git via Command Line (CLI)

The **command line** is the **most common, powerful, and flexible** way to use Git.

**Why Command Line is Popular**

- Provides **full control** over Git
- Supports **all Git features** without limitation
- Works on **any system**, including servers
- Faster once you get used to it
- Ideal for automation and scripting

**Real-World Scenario**

Sometimes, **GUI tools are not available**.

For example:
- You connect to a **remote Linux server via SSH**
- You **do not have permission** to install GUI software
- The server has **no graphical environment**

In such cases, **command-line Git is the only option**.

>Because of its **universality and reliability**, learning Git via CLI is **mandatory for system engineers and DevOps roles**.

## 2. Using Git via Code Editors & IDEs

Most modern **code editors and IDEs** come with **built-in Git support** or extensions.

This approach provides a **visual interface** while still using Git underneath.

**Popular Editors with Git Support**

- Visual Studio Code
- IntelliJ IDEA
- PyCharm
- Eclipse
- Atom

**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**

VS Code is one of the **most widely used editors** today.

It provides:
- Built-in Git integration
- Visual diff (file comparison)
- Easy staging and committing
- Branch management

**Popular VS Code Git Extensions**

**GitLens**
- Shows who changed which line
- Displays commit history per file
- Improves code traceability

## 3. Using Git via Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)

Git can also be used through **standalone GUI applications**.

These tools provide a **purely graphical experience**, without typing commands.

**Git GUI Tools**

The official Git website maintains a **complete list of GUI tools** for:

- Linux
- Windows
- macOS

**Popular Git GUI Tools**

- **GitKraken**
- **SourceTree**

**Advantages of GUI Tools**

- Easy to visualize branches
- Clear commit graphs
- Beginner-friendly
- Useful for complex merge scenarios

**Limitations of GUI Tools**

- Not always available on servers
- Some advanced Git features may be hidden
- Less flexible than CLI
- Can slow down learning of core Git concepts

GUI tools are helpful, but **should not replace command-line knowledge**.

## Final Advice (System Engineer’s View)

If you are serious about:
- Linux administration
- DevOps
- Cloud engineering
- System engineering

👉 **Start with Git command line** \
👉 Then use **editors and GUI tools as helpers**, not replacements
